# Markdown with Tooltip, bullet list and Number list

This README explains three important Markdown features with examples and why they are used.

🖼️ 1. Clickable Images with Tooltip

Syntax:
```
[![Mini Robot](https://via.placeholder.com/150 "This is a cute mini robot")](https://example.com)
```


Explanation:

Alt text → shown if image doesn’t load.

"Tooltip text" → appears when you hover over the image.

(link_url) → makes the image clickable (redirects to another page).

Example:

[![Mini Robot](https://via.placeholder.com/150 "This is a cute mini robot")](https://example.com)

👉 Why use it?

To make documentation more interactive.

To connect images with links (like logo → homepage).

Tooltip helps explain image without extra text.

🔢 2. Numbered Lists

Syntax:

1. Step one  
2. Step two  
3. Step three  


Explanation:

Numbers are written manually, but Markdown auto-fixes them.

Even if you write 1. for all items, Markdown will show them as 1, 2, 3….

Example:
```
1. Wake up

2. Study Markdown

3. Practice 
```

👉 Why use it?

To show steps in order.

Useful in tutorials, instructions, or processes.

🔘 3. Bulleted Lists

Syntax:

- Item A  
- Item B  
- Item C  


Explanation:

Use -, *, or + to create bullet points.

Best for unordered information (no sequence needed).

Example:
```
+ Apple
+ Banana
+ Mango
```

👉 Why use it?

To list items quickly.

Great for notes, features, or points that don’t need numbering.

✅ Summary

Clickable Image with Tooltip → makes images interactive and informative.

Numbered List → shows ordered steps clearly.

Bulleted List → shows unordered points simply.

👉 Markdown is simple but powerful for making documentation clear, readable, and professional.
