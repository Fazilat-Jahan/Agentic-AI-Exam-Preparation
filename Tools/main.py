#Tool: LLm can think and talk but for extra real task or live data, it needs to call tools. 
# Let's suppose you ask to agent about Dubai weather, an agent(LLM) may reply it's probably sunny or hot (hallucination), but for real accurate weather, agent needs to call a Weather tool which reply with live weather conditions of Dubai.

#There are several types of tools

#1. Function Tools -
#   These are simple Python functions that you define yourself.
#   Example: A calculator function, a CSV reader, etc.

#2. API Based Tools -
#   These tools call an external API to get fresh data.
#   Example: Weather API, News API, Stock Price API etc.

#3. Hosted Tools -
#   These tools are already hosted on a server (by OpenAI).
#   They are used for searching, browsing, or analyzing.
#   Example: file_search, code_interpreter, web_browser etc.

#4. Agent as Tool -
#   This allows you to use an agent as a tool, so one agent can call another agent
#   without handing off control. The main agent stays in charge.
#   Example: A "Customer Service Agent" using a "Booking Agent" as a tool,
#   but still keeping control of the conversation.

#1. Function Tools -
#   These are simple Python functions that you define yourself.
#   Example: A calculator function, a CSV reader, etc.


# Define a simple calculator tool
@function_tool #it is a decorator that registers Python function as a tool for the agent.
#simple python function to add two numbers

)

#  Rest of the tool types will be discussed soon in detail.
