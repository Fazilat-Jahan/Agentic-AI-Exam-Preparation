# Model Settings & Resolve Method

This folder contains files that demonstrate how to use **Model Settings** and the **resolve() method** in Agents SDK.

---

ðŸ“‚ **File Explanation**

- **main.py** â†’ Demonstrates basic Model Settings (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, `tool_choice`) for controlling agent responses.  
- **resolve_method.py** â†’ Demonstrates the `resolve()` method for merging base and override settings to create dynamic behavior.  

---

ðŸ–¥ **How to Use**

1. Run `main.py` to see basic model settings in action.  
2. Run `resolve_method.py` to see how `resolve()` merges settings for different response types.  
3. Observe console logs for agent responses.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip** ðŸ‘‰ Play with the code, change `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and tool usage settings to better understand how Model Settings and `resolve()` affect agent responses.
